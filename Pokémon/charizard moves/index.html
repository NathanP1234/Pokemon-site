    <div class="container">
      <div class="pokemon" id="charizard">
        <p>Charizard is a heavy attacker, with much of its moveset focused on raw power rather than strategic battling, however, it still has quite some </p>
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="one">
        <p>Smokescreen: depending in what region your charizard is in, it will learn smokescreen at a different level, though usually it is around level 20, this attack lowers the opponent's accuracy, useful due to Charizard's low base attack IV</p>
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="two">
        <p>Ember: a fire type attack that can be learned really early on by either TMs or level up, this attack doesn't have amazing damage, but it doesn't matter because of charizard's high attack, but it also has a good chance to burn the opponent, helpful in most cases to chip down the opponent's health</p>
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="three">
        <p>Metal Claw: a steel type attack with really good attack power, as well being learned really early, at level 13 for charmander, 3 levels before it evolves into charmeleon and over 30 before it evolves into charizard</p>
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="four">
        <p>Flamethrower: a really powerful fire type attack, its chance to leave a burn is quite a bit lower than ember, however, it makes up for it with an AP of 90</p>
