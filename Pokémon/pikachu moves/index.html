    <h1>Pikachu moves</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="pokemon" id="pikachu">
        <p>Pikachu has a fairly limited move pool, given its strictly electric typing, it does get some fairly strong attacks available through tms, but its level up moves are still descent regardless</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="one">
        <p>10,000,000-volt thunderbolt: pikachu's most powerful attack, a z-move made available in the Alola region exclusively, it deals massive damage, however, it is limited to once a battle</p>
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="two">
        <p>Iron Tail: a basic steel type move with pretty good attack power, it can be learned by tm, only up until the fourth generation, so if you want this move, you will have to get a pikachu from Johto, Sinnoh, Kanto, or Hoenn</p>    
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="three">
        <p>Nuzzle: a basic attack with only 20 attack power and 20 pp, it does however cause paralysis to any Pokémon (other than electric and ground types)</p>    
    </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="four">
        <p>Surf: a harder attack to obtain, needing to do many odd quests in order to obtain it, surf is a great attack, giving it the ability to attack Pokémon usually immune to its attacks, surf is a good water move that also allows you to ride your pikachu over water</p>
