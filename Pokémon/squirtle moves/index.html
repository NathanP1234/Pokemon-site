    <h1>Squirtle moves</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="pokemon" id="squirtle">
        <p>Squirtle's move pool has probably the least varied move pool, besides maybe pikachu, however, the moves it can learn are quite good</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="one">
        <p>Deluge: a water type attack with 140 base power, it also lowers the opponents special attack by a large amount, allowing squirtle and its evo line to take on electric types without too much of a problem, despite the x2 weakness</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="two">
        <p>Bubble: an early water type move, it only has 40 AP, but can attack all adjecent Pokémon in double, triple, or quad battles, it is useful in some situations, though later on there are many better water type moves</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="three">
        <p>Surf: just like pikachu, squirtle can learn surf, allowing you to ride squirtle on bodies of water, it also damages all adjacent Pokémon, but now with 100 AP</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="four">
        <p>Aqua Tail: a 90 AP move really useful early on, aqua tail can be taught via level up, TM, and it can be passed on by breeding, it has no extra effects aside from damage</p>
      </div>
