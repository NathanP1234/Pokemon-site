    <h1>Bulbasaur moves</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="pokemon" id="bulbasaur">
        <p>Bulbasaur has a much more varied move pool than most of the other Pok√©mon on this website thanks to its dual typing and high base defense stat</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="one">
        <p>Sludge Bomb: a good poison type attack with 90 Ap and a max of 16 PP, sludge bomb can be used to make the normal sludge attack deal double damage if used the next turn, as well as the fact it has a 30% chance to poison the target, allowing great chip damage if it lands</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="two">
        <p>Leech Seed: an amazing HP stealing move, it has really good accuracy, though only a base of 10 PP and a max of 16, it seeds the target, dealing chip damage as well as healing half the damage done back to itself, combining this with a big root, and you can heal good amounts of HP</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="three">
        <p>sleep powder: a grass type attack with fairly low accuracy (75%), this attack puts the opponent to sleep, allowing you to attack it without having to worry about getting hit yourself, though the sleep status effect wears off rather quickly</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pokemon" id="four">
        <p>Solar Beam: a grass type attack that takes a turn to charge up, as well as causing sunny weather, which boosts fire attacks, this attack has massive drawbacks, however, it has 120 AP and 100% accuracy, meaning that, unless the opponent has a boosted evasion stat, this attack rarely misses</p>
